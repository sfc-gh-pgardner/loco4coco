-- Loco4CoCo booth objects.
--
-- Only DEFINE, GRANT and ATTACH statements are permitted in a DCM definition
-- file, and every object must be fully qualified. DEFINE behaves as
-- CREATE OR ALTER, so this file is the desired end state: removing a statement
-- DROPS the object on the next deploy.
--
-- Resource monitors are NOT a supported DEFINE entity, so LOCO4COCO_RM lives in
-- hooks/post_hook.sql instead. That is Snowflake's documented pattern for
-- unsupported object types.

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- compute
-- X-Small, 60s auto-suspend. INITIALLY_SUSPENDED is immutable in DCM, which
-- suits the default-posture-off cost rule: the warehouse only runs when
-- something actually needs it.
--
-- Generation is deliberately NOT pinned. The London warehouse was created as
-- STANDARD_GEN_2 (which bills ~1.35 credits/hour rather than 1.0), and
-- RESOURCE_CONSTRAINT cannot be used to change it - Snowflake rejects it and
-- directs you to a GENERATION property whose accepted syntax did not work here
-- either. At one INSERT per visitor the difference is a rounding error, so this
-- is left as-is on purpose rather than chased. A NEW account gets whatever the
-- default generation is, which is fine.

-- ------------------------------------------------------- shared booth context
-- The five tables below are the *shared* half of the activation: the closed
-- lists that decide what a blueprint may name. The repo markdown under
-- skills/loco4coco/references/ stays the source of truth and the offline
-- fallback; these tables are how that content reaches another SE's laptop, or
-- Paris, without asking them to pull a git branch.
--
-- They are deliberately NOT an MCP server. MCP is not guaranteed on a borrowed
-- booth laptop (managed settings can disable user and plugin servers), whereas
-- a Snowflake connection is already a hard requirement. Sharing these is then
-- an ordinary secure share or listing.
--
-- Loaded by deploy/load_context.py, which parses the markdown and MERGEs. The
-- server reads them at boot and falls back to the markdown on any failure, so
-- an empty table is degraded, never broken.
