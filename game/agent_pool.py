"""A warm Cortex Code agent, held open between visitors.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
`cortex exec` is a one-shot CI/CD entry point. It has no `--resume`, no
`--session` and no `--daemon`, so every call is a cold Node process that re-reads
config, authenticates, and discovers skills and MCP servers before it thinks
about the prompt. Measured on a trivial prompt:

    cortex exec                                         22.7s
    cortex exec --no-mcp                                 19.4s
    + --no-history --effort minimal --max-turns 1        18.1s

So roughly **18 seconds is startup**, not inference, and flags recover under five
of it. On a five-minute visit where the Workshop stop was measured at a 26s
median, that is the single largest slice of the visitor's time.

`cortex mcp serve` runs the same binary in server mode over stdio. Same measured
work, warm:

    startup, once                                         1.3s
    first call                                            9.4s
    second call                                           6.0s

That is the entire point of this module: pay the startup once, when the booth
opens, instead of once per visitor.

THE LOCK IS NOT OPTIONAL
------------------------
Two `tools/call` requests were issued on one process without waiting. `id=10`
asked the agent to reply ALPHA; `id=20` asked it to reply BRAVO. **Both came back
ALPHA.** The second request received the first one's payload.

On a stand that is the worst class of bug available to us: one visitor's content
in another visitor's document, with nothing raising an error. So this pool holds a
single mutex and permits exactly one in-flight call per process, always. Do not
"optimise" that away. If concurrency is ever needed, run a second process.

WHAT IT DOES NOT CARRY
----------------------
The agent is stateless between calls - a codeword stored in one call was answered
with NO CONTEXT in the next - so warming cannot leak one visitor's data into the
next visitor's turn. Verified before this was built, because on a shared booth
laptop that had to be true rather than hoped for.

Ambient MCP servers are not exposed: this laptop has eleven configured and the
agent reported none of them. It does hold `bash`, `edit`, `write`, `sql_execute`
and `web_fetch`, which is why `allowed_tools` defaults to a narrow list here.

IT MUST SURVIVE A CORTEX VERSION THAT CANNOT SERVE IT
-----------------------------------------------------
The booth runs on a borrowed laptop with whatever `cortex` is installed on it,
and `cortex mcp serve` is not a stable contract. Four failure modes were tested
with stub binaries on PATH, and all four now degrade in BOUNDED time so that
`run_turn`'s next layer (`cortex exec`) answers the visitor:

    no `cortex` on PATH at all          start() -> False        0.0s
    starts then exits immediately       start() -> False        0.0s
    serves, but no cortex_code_agent    detected at startup     0.1s/turn
    serves, initialises, never replies  TimeoutError            bounded

The third and fourth were the dangerous ones. A version that exposes no
`cortex_code_agent` is now detected ONCE by `_check_capability()` at startup and
latched in `self.unsupported`, so `ask()` declines instantly rather than spending
a slice of every visitor's budget rediscovering it.

The fourth was a real defect, not a hypothetical: `_read_until()` computed a
deadline but then blocked in `self._p.stdout.readline()`, which has no timeout, so
the deadline was only ever checked BETWEEN lines. A CLI that started and then went
quiet hung forever - and it hung *underneath* the whole fallback chain, so there
was no exec, no COMPLETE and no precomputed answer, just a visitor watching an
empty bubble. stdout is now drained by a daemon thread into a queue, which is what
makes the deadline real. Do not "simplify" that back to a direct readline().

`cortex resume [session_id]` appeared at top level in v1.1.91, but `cortex exec`
still has no `--resume`/`--session`, so everything above still holds. Verified
against v1.1.91: start 1.9s, then calls at 5.1s / 3.9s / 3.9s.
