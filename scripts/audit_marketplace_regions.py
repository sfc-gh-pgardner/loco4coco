"""Audit every curated Marketplace pick against the live catalogue, per EVENT region.

Each profile is judged against ITS OWN EVENT's region, never the booth account's.
The visitor never imports anything at the booth - they open the links later from
their own account - so what matters is whether the dataset is available where THEY
are. London is judged on eu-west-2 even though every booth account is Frankfurt.
That is why one Frankfurt account can audit all three events.

This VERIFIES; it does not recurate. curate_locality.py replaces a whole stall and
will re-add a listing an earlier review deliberately deleted, so a blanket re-run
would silently undo curation decisions. Run this first, then fix only what it
names.

Four things can be wrong with a pick, and all four are judged on signals that are
GLOBAL rather than local to the account running the audit:

  GONE      no longer in the catalogue at all - a visitor gets a dead link
  REGION    exists, but not offered in that event's region - the link works and
            the import does not
  REQUEST   is_by_request - the visitor must ask the provider and wait, so the
            "click this and it is yours" promise does not hold
  DISCOVER  discover_only - visible in the catalogue but not obtainable
  PAID      the curated access label says Paid, and nothing Paid ships

TWO SIGNALS ARE DELIBERATELY NOT USED, because they are local to whichever account
runs the audit and reporting them as defects is how good picks get binned.

`is_ready_for_import` reports whether THIS account can import the listing. Run from
a Frankfurt booth account it is false for London picks that a London visitor can
import without trouble - measured: every London pick it flagged was present in
eu-west-2 and absent from eu-central-1. Judging an event's picks on it inverts the
whole point of auditing per event region.

`is_monetized` marks the listing as a paid product, which does not mean a visitor
cannot start on it for free: several curated picks are monetized listings carrying
a 7, 14, 30 or 60 day free trial, and the curated `access` string already records
exactly that. The trial is not always reflected in `is_limited_trial`, so
monetized-plus-trial is normal rather than a defect. The curated label is the
claim worth checking, and that is what PAID checks.
