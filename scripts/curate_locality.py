"""Curate the per-city Marketplace picks with region-filtered Marketplace search.

Uses `cortex search marketplace` with an explicit cloudRegion filter, which is
what makes this correct AND fast:

    cortex search marketplace "<use case> for <country>" \
        --filter '{"cloudRegion":["AWS_EU_WEST_3"]}'

WHY THIS AND NOT A FREE-FORM AGENT PROMPT. The first attempt asked an agent, in
prose, to find listings for a country and to honour a region. MEASURED: 91
candidates, 0 hallucinated, but 78 unavailable in the event's region, and
strengthening the prompt to make the region a hard requirement changed nothing -
because the region is a FILTER PARAMETER on the search, not something to ask for
politely. Supplying it directly returns region-correct results in ~7 seconds
instead of ~237, and it returns provider names, which SHOW AVAILABLE LISTINGS
does not expose.

The region searched is the EVENT LOCATION's, never the booth account's. Every
event runs on an AWS Frankfurt account, but the visitor never imports anything at
the booth - they leave with links and open them later from their own account - so
what matters is that a dataset is relevant and available where THEY are.

    python3 scripts/curate_locality.py --profile fr de -c Frankfurt_L4C
    python3 scripts/curate_locality.py --profile fr --dry-run      # look first

Writes profiles.<profile> in references/marketplace.json (6 primary + reserves
per industry) and leaves every other profile untouched.
